  abstract={Probabilistic forecasting of epidemiological time series remains challenging due to non-stationary disease dynamics, sparse observations, and heterogeneous data regimes. We present Adaptive Quantile Diffusion (AQDiff), a novel diffusion-based framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) multi-dataset pre-training of a unified time series diffusion model across heterogeneous epidemiological domains, and (2) adaptive quantile guidance that dynamically adjusts prediction intervals based on local residual statistics. AQDiff introduces a feedback loop where recent forecast errors inform quantile adjustments through an exponentially weighted buffer, enabling real-time adaptation to volatility shifts. Pre-training on influenza-like illness (ILI), COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) allows cross-domain knowledge transfer. Experiments demonstrate that AQDiff reduces mean absolute error (MAE) by as much as 73.3% compared to state-of-the-art baselines (CSDI, PatchTST) across three pandemic forecasting tasks. Our analysis reveals that adaptive quantile guidance provides statistically significant improvements during outbreak surges, while pre-training enhances robustness to limited training data. The framework maintains computational efficiency, adding less than 10% overhead compared to fixed-quantile diffusion models.},
