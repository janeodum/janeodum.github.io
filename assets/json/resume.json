    "summary": "With over four years of experience in the tech industry, I am a passionate and versatile software engineer and researcher, pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at The University of Georgia. My main focus is on the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, where I aim to develop multimodal machine learning models that can understand and generate content from different data types, such as text, images, audio, and video. \n As a teaching assistant at UGA, I mentor and assist undergraduate students in various computer science courses, such as algorithm analysis, data structures, and programming languages. As a software engineer cadet at 42 Silicon Valley, I work on challenging and innovative projects, such as building a web application with Java and Spring Boot, or designing a robot-human collaboration system with ROS and TensorFlow. I have also acquired multiple skills and certifications in web development, application security, and problem solving, as well as recognition for my leadership and diversity efforts in the tech community",

      "summary": "• Developed AQDiff, a diffusion-based framework for epidemiological forecasting, leveraging multi-dataset pre-training (CDC influenza, COVID-19, RSV) and adaptive quantile guidance to dynamically adjust prediction intervals. Achieved 73.3% lower MAE than state-of-the-art models (CSDI, PatchTST) across pandemic scenarios. • Introduced real-time error feedback via exponentially weighted residual statistics, enhancing volatility adaptation with <10% computational overhead. Demonstrated robustness in sparse data methods and statistically significant improvements during outbreak surges."
