Building on the idea that collaboration and community are essential for student success, **Factor Social** is a platform designed to connect university students through shared courses, interest groups, and events. By unifying academic and social spheres, it aims to create a dynamic, supportive environment that helps students learn and grow together.

## About Factor Social

Factor Social addresses two key challenges often faced by university students:

1. **Fragmentation**: Students may rely on multiple messaging apps, forums, or social media platforms to coordinate activities, forming scattered communities.
2. **Lack of Discovery**: It can be difficult to find like-minded peers, study groups, or upcoming events tailored to a student’s interests and major.

**Factor Social** tackles these issues by providing:

- **Dedicated Course Hubs**: Connect with classmates for collaborative study sessions, share notes, and discuss assignments.
- **Interest Groups**: Form or join clubs around topics like AI, art, or entrepreneurship, and discover peers with similar passions.
- **Event Calendar**: Stay updated on campus events and even organize your own meetups—no more missed deadlines for extracurriculars.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    </div>

<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
