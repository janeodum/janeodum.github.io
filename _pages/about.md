## Current Position

I’m a Computer Science Ph.D. student in the NES Lab (Neuro-Symbolic Computing Lab) at University of Georgia, working under Dr. John Miller. My research focuses on advancing time series forecasting through generative models, machine learning, and deep learning techniques.

## What I Do

I develop machine learning systems that predict future trends from complex time series data. My work involves designing and training generative models, such as diffusion models, to address real-world challenges like noisy data, uncertainty, and shifting patterns. I'm particularly interested in applications where precise forecasts can drive meaningful impact—whether in predicting disease spread during pandemics or anticipating economic trends. My goal is to create models that are both powerful and practical, enabling better decision-making.

## My Background

Before my Ph.D., I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Ilorin, Nigeria, where I developed a passion for solving problems through code. I later honed my software engineering skills at the 42 Silicon Valley bootcamp in California, gaining experience in building scalable systems and collaborating on complex technical projects.

Now, as a researcher, I merge this engineering mindset with my passion for machine learning. My current work explores how generative models and deep learning can enhance time series forecasting, particularly in high-stakes scenarios like pandemic prediction. By tackling challenges such as sparse data and real-time adaptation, I aim to develop AI tools that are both reliable and accessible to the communities that need them most.
