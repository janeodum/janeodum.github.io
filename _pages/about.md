## Current Position

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student in the NES Lab (Neuro-Symbolic Computing Lab) at University of Georgia, working under Dr. John Miller. My research focuses on advancing time series forecasting through generative models, machine learning, and deep learning techniques.

## What I Do

I develop machine learning systems that predict future trends from complex time series data. My work involves designing and training generative models, such as diffusion models, to address real-world challenges like noisy data, uncertainty, and shifting patterns. I am particularly interested in applications where precise forecasts can drive meaningful impact, whether in predicting disease spread during pandemics or anticipating economic and social trends. My goal is to create models that are both powerful and practical, that drives better decision-making.

## My Background

Before my Ph.D., I earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Ilorin, Nigeria, where I developed a passion for solving problems through code. I later honed my software engineering skills at the 42 Silicon Valley bootcamp in California, gaining experience in building scalable systems and collaborating on complex technical projects.

Now, as a researcher, I blend my engineering mindset with my passion for machine learning. My current work focuses on using generative models and deep learning to advance time series forecasting, especially in high-stakes areas like pandemic prediction. Solving challenges such as sparse data and continuous updates, I aim to create AI tools that are both robust and easily accessible to the communities that need them most.

When I am not immersed in research or coding, I love staying active with weight lifting and hiking, getting creative through painting and dancing, and experimenting in the kitchen with new recipes.
